                    <p>I grew up in Florida and Alabama in a household that supported my creative writing. I wrote my first book about a secret agent fighting bioterrorism (inspired from a video game called <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Syphon_Filter">Syphon Filter</a>)  in the 5th grade, and then I went on to write four books in high school and college. They’re tucked away in my parents’ attic or are on super old floppy disks, but one day I’ll rewrite them and publish those books! Until then, I’m an assistant professor in the English Department at the University of Missouri Kansas City! Before moving to Kansas City in 2019, I lived in Madison, Wisconsin where I finished my doctoral degree in composition and rhetoric. During those 4 and half years I learned a lot about how we use writing for justice, love, and peace in a world of pain and inequality and use those lessons in my teaching, research, and writing!

                    <p>I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in Black/African American literacy, professional and technical communication, multimodal composition, and digital rhetoric. My approach to teaching can be summed up in one sentence I often tell students in my syllabi: This class isn’t a bootcamp; it’s a playground. So I give students a variety of current theories in composition and rhetoric and issues and controversies in writing of all kinds. Students use assignments to explore, find solutions, and pose serious questions about what writing does for us. I make classes open so students find meaningful writing projects that draw on their personal, professional, and academic pursuits. Each class explores how writing and our beliefs about writing can support liberating or oppressive policies, practices, laws, and behaviors that separate us. In this way, students not only understand writing as one tool that leads to a good job but it also helps commitment to community action in our neighborhoods! Check out a sample of courses I teach to learn how I carry out this teaching philosophy!</p>

                                In this undergraduate course, students explore how nature, tools, and practices of literacy changes as writing technologies evolve and  howthat presents new challenges to how we conduct our lives. Throughout the course, we hold to one very important idea that will keep coming in our discussions: Writing is not a neutral, value-free skill but rather a type of knowledge and practice that shapes how we perceive our world and interact with others; writing participates in our oppression but also in our liberation. Because this is a writing intensive course, the course highlights revision and reflection on students' writing processes. Our projects include literacy archive essays, data visualization, and writing a series of short essays with the help of artificial intelligence.

                                In this undergraduate and graduate course, students practice communicating technical knowledge for diverse audiences. Students learn current theories and research methods in professional and technical writing and then apply their knowledge and skills developed in their major to individual and team-based writing projects. In this course, we consider how technical communication must consider multi- and inter-cultural contexts and are influenced by institutions and systems of power. To this end, we create civic technologies -- public digital goods that benefit and solve problems in the local community. Examples of civic technologies include a mobile app that maps lots that could be used for housing or a website that connects donors with nonprofits.

                                In this graduate course, students explore issues of composition theory, history, research, and pedagogy related to social justice. Doing so recognizes that teaching writing in American universities is fraught with political and cultural implications that can have long-term consequences for all students, especially historical excluded people. The following questions guide the course: What is the purpose of a writing class? How do we best prepare students to write in, outside of and after college? Answers to these questions help students build or re-examine their relationship with composition and rhetoric, determine how writing teachers foster relationships with students, and how writing teachers design classrooms, online and in-person.

                    <p> As a researcher, I study how the legacies of literacy for liberation and humanity carry forward into new technologies and media features. To this end, I learn how racially marginalized people create their own means for transformative access using computer technologies. My approach is qualitative: interviewing community members, participating in community members’ events, collecting artifacts meaningful to their lives, and honoring their voices through writing and presentations. I’m writing a book manuscript called The Literacy Pivot: How Black Adults Learn Computer Programming in a Racist World. The book is based on a year-long ethnographic study on Black adults attending Clearwater Academy to learn computer programming for a potential career in tech. It highlights their triumphs and desires with and about coding and how they use their experiences to address racial inequality in their lives. Two articles below give a preview into the book! Watch for more news on the manuscript! :)

                                This study examines how African American adults attending a code bootcamp continue to learn coding literacy despite life challenges associated with racial oppression. suggest that participants use various clusters of support in their network to provide the personal resources coders need to code and what is hard to come by in situations of racial injustice. Instead of a universal approach to accessing technology, different kinds of networks and resources can lead to continuous access. This study furthers research on racially marginalized adults’ digital literacies and demonstrates how ego network analysis maybe useful for qualitative research on theories of ecological writing.

                                Some computer code bootcamps offer racially marginalized adults training in computer programming to assist in their social mobility. Many African American adults have little to no prior experience with programming. Literacy life history interviews show that the procedural literacy adult students practiced out of school scaffolded their learning coding literacy.

                    <p>I believe that if public dollars supports my research then my research should be used to benefit community organizers and community learners. I volunteer in Kansas City to achieve this goal, from teaching workshops on race and racism to offering my own skills in writing and research to benefit charity partners. In addition, I link students with nonprofits for capacity-building projects! Listening to the needs of community partners, students create prototypes that community partners may or may not improve and use for later use. This approach maintains sustainable relationships between the university and the Metro Area and doesn't overburden already busy nonprofits! In the past, I've worked with Code for KC, Global FC, MARC, and Center for Neighborhoods! I would love to connect with others and learn how I and my students can serve you!</p>

                                When I moved to Kansas City, Missouri in August 2019, a friend and colleague introduced me to <a href="https://codeforkc.org/">Code for KC</a>, a chapter of Code for America comprised of "developers, designers, data geeks, policy buffs, and idea makers" that work with local government to make Kansas City a better place for all. I work as a content writers and advisory board member for Re.Use.Full. This website is like Tinder: matches donors with lightly used goods to giveaway with charity partners that need them!

                                In summer 2021 I taught a community course called Writing Counterstories about Race and Racism in Kansas City for <a href="https://www.trinitykc.org/">Trinity United Methodist Church</a>. In this six-week online course, a class of majority-White community learners first learned about what critical race theory and counterstories are. Then we brainstomed what race and racism looks like in the present and waht they looked like in the past. Having confronted White privilege and the limitations of liberal civil rights, students wrote and workshopped their own counterstories. The course concluded with naming actions the Church could committ to in the coming months.
