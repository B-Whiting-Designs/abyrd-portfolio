                    <p>I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in Black/African American literacy, professional and technical communication, multimodal composition, and digital rhetoric. My approach to teaching can be summed up in one sentence I often tell students in my syllabi: This class isn’t a bootcamp; it’s a playground. So I give students a variety of current theories in composition and rhetoric and issues and controversies in writing of all kinds. Students use assignments to explore, find solutions, and pose serious questions about what writing does for us. I make classes open so students find meaningful writing projects that draw on their personal, professional, and academic pursuits. Each class explores how writing and our beliefs about writing can support liberating or oppressive policies, practices, laws, and behaviors that separate us. In this way, students not only understand writing as one tool that leads to a good job but it also helps commitment to community action in our neighborhoods! Check out a sample of courses I teach to learn how I carry out this teaching philosophy!</p>

                                In this undergraduate course, students explore how nature, tools, and practices of literacy changes as writing technologies evolve and  howthat presents new challenges to how we conduct our lives. Throughout the course, we hold to one very important idea that will keep coming in our discussions: Writing is not a neutral, value-free skill but rather a type of knowledge and practice that shapes how we perceive our world and interact with others; writing participates in our oppression but also in our liberation. Because this is a writing intensive course, the course highlights revision and reflection on students' writing processes. Our projects include literacy archive essays, data visualization, and writing a series of short essays with the help of artificial intelligence.

                                In this undergraduate and graduate course, students practice communicating technical knowledge for diverse audiences. Students learn current theories and research methods in professional and technical writing and then apply their knowledge and skills developed in their major to individual and team-based writing projects. In this course, we consider how technical communication must consider multi- and inter-cultural contexts and are influenced by institutions and systems of power. To this end, we create civic technologies -- public digital goods that benefit and solve problems in the local community. Examples of civic technologies include a mobile app that maps lots that could be used for housing or a website that connects donors with nonprofits.

                                In this graduate course, students explore issues of composition theory, history, research, and pedagogy related to social justice. Doing so recognizes that teaching writing in American universities is fraught with political and cultural implications that can have long-term consequences for all students, especially historical excluded people. The following questions guide the course: What is the purpose of a writing class? How do we best prepare students to write in, outside of and after college? Answers to these questions help students build or re-examine their relationship with composition and rhetoric, determine how writing teachers foster relationships with students, and how writing teachers design classrooms, online and in-person.
