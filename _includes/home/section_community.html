                    <p>I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in Black/African American literacy, professional and technical communication, multimodal composition, and digital rhetoric. My approach to teaching can be summed up in one sentence I often tell students in my syllabi: This class isn’t a bootcamp; it’s a playground. So I give students a variety of current theories in composition and rhetoric and issues and controversies in writing of all kinds. Students use assignments to explore, find solutions, and pose serious questions about what writing does for us. I make classes open so students find meaningful writing projects that draw on their personal, professional, and academic pursuits. Each class explores how writing and our beliefs about writing can support liberating or oppressive policies, practices, laws, and behaviors that separate us. In this way, students not only understand writing as one tool that leads to a good job but it also helps commitment to community action in our neighborhoods!

                                In this undergraduate course, students explore how nature, tools, and practices of literacy changes as writing technologies evolve and  howthat presents new challenges to how we conduct our lives. Throughout the course, we hold to one very important idea that will keep coming in our discussions: Writing is not a neutral, value-free skill but rather a type of knowledge and practice that shapes how we perceive our world and interact with others; writing participates in our oppression but also in our liberation. Because this is a writing intensive course, the course highlights revision and reflection on students' writing processes. Our projects include literacy archive essays, data visualization, and writing a series of short essays with the help of artificial intelligence.

                                In summer 2021 I taught a community course called Writing Counterstories about Race and Racism in Kansas City for <a href="https://www.trinitykc.org/">Trinity United Methodist Church</a>. In this six-week online course, a class of majority-White community learners first learned about what critical race theory and counterstories are. Then we brainstomed what race and racism looks like in the present and waht they looked like in the past. Having confronted White privilege and the limitations of liberal civil rights, students wrote and workshopped their own counterstories. The course concluded with naming actions the Church could committ to in the coming months.
