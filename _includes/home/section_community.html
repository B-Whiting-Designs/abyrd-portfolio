                    <p>I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in Black/African American literacy, professional and technical communication, multimodal composition, and digital rhetoric. My approach to teaching can be summed up in one sentence I often tell students in my syllabi: This class isn’t a bootcamp; it’s a playground. So I give students a variety of current theories in composition and rhetoric and issues and controversies in writing of all kinds. Students use assignments to explore, find solutions, and pose serious questions about what writing does for us. I make classes open so students find meaningful writing projects that draw on their personal, professional, and academic pursuits. Each class explores how writing and our beliefs about writing can support liberating or oppressive policies, practices, laws, and behaviors that separate us. In this way, students not only understand writing as one tool that leads to a good job but it also helps commitment to community action in our neighborhoods!

                                When I moved to Kansas City, MO in August 2019, a friend and colleague introduced me to <a href="https://codeforkc.org/">Code for KC</a>, a chapter of Code for America comprised of "developers, designers, data geeks, policy buffs, and idea makers" that work with local government to make Kansas City a better place for all. I work as a content writers and advisory board member for Re.Use.Full. This website is like Tinder: matches donors with lightly used goods to giveaway with charity partners that need them!

                                In summer 2021 I taught a community course called Writing Counterstories about Race and Racism in Kansas City for <a href="https://www.trinitykc.org/">Trinity United Methodist Church</a>. In this six-week online course, a class of majority-White community learners first learned about what critical race theory and counterstories are. Then we brainstomed what race and racism looks like in the present and waht they looked like in the past. Having confronted White privilege and the limitations of liberal civil rights, students wrote and workshopped their own counterstories. The course concluded with naming actions the Church could committ to in the coming months.
