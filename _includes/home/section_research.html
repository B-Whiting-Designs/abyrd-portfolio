                    <p> As a researcher, I study how the legacies of literacy for liberation and humanity carry forward into new technologies and media features. To this end, I learn how racially marginalized people create their own means for transformative access using computer technologies. My approach is qualitative: interviewing community members, participating in community members’ events, collecting artifacts meaningful to their lives, and honoring their voices through writing and presentations. I’m writing a book manuscript called The Literacy Pivot: How Black Adults Learn Computer Programming in a Racist World. The book is based on a year-long ethnographic study on Black adults attending Clearwater Academy to learn computer programming for a potential career in tech. It highlights their triumphs and desires with and about coding and how they use their experiences to address racial inequality in their lives. Two articles below give a preview into the book! Watch for more news on the manuscript! :)

                                In this undergraduate course, students explore how nature, tools, and practices of literacy changes as writing technologies evolve and  howthat presents new challenges to how we conduct our lives. Throughout the course, we hold to one very important idea that will keep coming in our discussions: Writing is not a neutral, value-free skill but rather a type of knowledge and practice that shapes how we perceive our world and interact with others; writing participates in our oppression but also in our liberation. Because this is a writing intensive course, the course highlights revision and reflection on students' writing processes. Our projects include literacy archive essays, data visualization, and writing a series of short essays with the help of artificial intelligence.

                                In this undergraduate and graduate course, students practice communicating technical knowledge for diverse audiences. Students learn current theories and research methods in professional and technical writing and then apply their knowledge and skills developed in their major to individual and team-based writing projects. In this course, we consider how technical communication must consider multi- and inter-cultural contexts and are influenced by institutions and systems of power. To this end, we create civic technologies -- public digital goods that benefit and solve problems in the local community. Examples of civic technologies include a mobile app that maps lots that could be used for housing or a website that connects donors with nonprofits.
