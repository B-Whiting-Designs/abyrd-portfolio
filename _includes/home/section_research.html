                    <p> As a researcher, I study how the legacies of literacy for liberation and humanity carry forward into new technologies and media features. To this end, I learn how racially marginalized people create their own means for transformative access using computer technologies. My approach is qualitative: interviewing community members, participating in community members’ events, collecting artifacts meaningful to their lives, and honoring their voices through writing and presentations. I’m writing a book manuscript called The Literacy Pivot: How Black Adults Learn Computer Programming in a Racist World. The book is based on a year-long ethnographic study on Black adults attending Clearwater Academy to learn computer programming for a potential career in tech. It highlights their triumphs and desires with and about coding and how they use their experiences to address racial inequality in their lives. Two articles below give a preview into the book! Watch for more news on the manuscript! :)

                                This study examines how African American adults attending a code bootcamp continue to learn coding literacy despite life challenges associated with racial oppression. suggest that participants use various clusters of support in their network to provide the personal resources coders need to code and what is hard to come by in situations of racial injustice. Instead of a universal approach to accessing technology, different kinds of networks and resources can lead to continuous access. This study furthers research on racially marginalized adults’ digital literacies and demonstrates how ego network analysis maybe useful for qualitative research on theories of ecological writing.

                                Some computer code bootcamps offer racially marginalized adults training in computer programming to assist in their social mobility. Many African American adults have little to no prior experience with programming. Literacy life history interviews show that the procedural literacy adult students practiced out of school scaffolded their learning coding literacy.
