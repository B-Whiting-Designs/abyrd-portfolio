                    <p>I grew up in Florida and Alabama in a household that supported my creative writing. I wrote my first book about a secret agent fighting bioterrorism (inspired from a video game called <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Syphon_Filter">Syphon Filter</a>)  in the 5th grade, and then I went on to write four books in high school and college. They’re tucked away in my parents’ basement or are on super old floppy disks but one day I’ll rewrite them and publish those books! Until then, I’m an assistant professor in the English Department at the University of Missouri Kansas City! Before moving to Kansas City in 2019, I lived in Madison, Wisconsin where I finished my doctoral degree in composition and rhetoric. During those 4 and half years I learned a lot about how we use writing for justice, love, and peace in a world of pain and inequality. As a teacher, researcher, and writer, I hope to bring those lessons to students and community learners in Kansas City while also learning from them what writing does for them.
