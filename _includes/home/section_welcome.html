                    <p>Iâ€™m an assistant professor in the English Department at <a href="https://www.umkc.edu/index.html">the University of Missouri Kansas City</a> located on the Indigenous land of the Missouria, Oto, Kansa, Osage, Shawnee, and Delaware. I serve as faculty fellow of the <a href="https://www.umkc.edu/cafe/">Diane Filion Center for Advancing Faculty Excellence (CAFE)</a> focusing on faculty professional learning in writing pedagogy and generative artificial intelligence. I'm also a member of the <a href="https://aiandwriting.hcommons.org/">MLA-CCC Task Force on Artificial Intelligence</a>. We are charged to develop resources, guidelines, and professional standards around the use of AI and writing for English teachers. I hold a PhD in composition and rhetoric from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My dissertation involved a qualitative study on Black adults attending a computer code bootcamp. The dissertation is now a completed book manuscript called <i>From Pipeline to Black Tech Ecosystems: How Black Adults Use Computer Code Bootcamps for Liberation</i> (currently with copyeditors at <a href="https://upcolorado.com/the-wac-clearinghouse#:~:text=The%20WAC%20Clearinghouse%20supports%20teachers,digital%20format%20for%20free%20download.">The WAC Clearinghouse / University Press of Colorado</a>) To learn more, please check out highlights of my work below and remember to say <a href="mailto:antoniobyrd@umkc.edu?subject=Hello Dr. Byrd!">say hello</a>! </p>
